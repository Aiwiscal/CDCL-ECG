**PAPER**: W. Liu, H. Zhang, S. Chang, H. Wang, J. He, Q. Huang, "A joint cross-dimensional contrastive learning framework for 12-lead ECGs and its heterogeneous deployment on SoC", _Comput. Biol. Med._ **152** (2023) 106390. https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2022.106390.

**ATTENTION**: As TensorFlow 2.x may be the mainstream version nowadays, we re-implemented the work in TensorFlow 2.5 and TensorFlow.Keras!

**DATASETS**: Datasets can be downloaded from https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Datasets_for_CDCL/21671255
